# Media-Valent
Test task from Media Valent (copy site, GET)

Mistakes which I fount in HTML:
  - there are five tag h1, but it should be just one on the page. Rude mistake. It will be a problem with CEO promotion because of this.
  - on the page can not be a similar id, but it is on this HTML page.
  - style description inside tag is a bad practice, but there are many cases on the page. All styles should be inside SCC files.
  - HTML semantics are not followed (for example there isn`t the header tag).
  - a lot of not useable blocks.
  - javascript code should be in js files.
  - The validator.w3.org shows 15 mistakes inside this file.
  
  Some of these problems I corrected.
  
  Mistakes which I fount inside the CSS file:
   - float is an outdated unit alignment method.
   - many repetitive styles.
   - media queries should be in another file.
   
   Some of these problems I corrected.
   
   All these problems will later harm the promotion of the site and display it by search engines.
   
   The task of transferring the input data from one HTML file to another was solved by me with the help of a GET request and some Javascript.
